#ajah (llll)

- Find top level expressions with their indexes
- Find their labels
- Make array of label -> expression
- parse all expressions
- Run the normal code we have now...

#TODO

- Custom parentheses checker that returns index of bad token
- A token run through that returns the index of a bad token if one is found
- Better nested label examples (super complex nesting)
- Throw an error when we hit infinite recursive labels (snake bits its tail)
- think of another type of labelling
